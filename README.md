# naive_bayes_and_pearson

The repositary consists of the implementation of naive bayes and peason's coeffecient to make the recommendation for a given user.

Naïve bayes prediction
In this method we calculate the gaussian probability density function since the variables are continuous , when the values of the attributes are given we can predict if he would click 
on the advertisement or not based on his internet usage, time spent, age, income.

Pearson coefficient measure
In this method we make use of user based recommender system to suggest the place to new user based on the Pearson measure by comparing his ratings to the other places with other users 
present in the data set. It helps us to make prediction whether the user would like or dislike the unseen place as the data we are using is the travel ratings.

The language used to write the program is c++.
Shell script is used to run the program.
Dialog package is used in the script for the graphical windows


For the naïve bayes algorithm we have used the advertisement dataset from the Kaggle which has attributes such as time spent in the web page,age,income,internet usage.

For the Pearson measure recommendation we have made use of a dataset from the uci machine learning repository which has the ratings of the users to different place’
